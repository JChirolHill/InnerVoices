# Major Characters vs. Minor Characters vs. Extras

### Major Characters
Protagonists: This is your leading man or woman. It’s the person the novel is “about,” or the character whose story lies at the novel’s core. Alternative names include the leading character, the central character and the main character.  Novels can have two or more protagonists, though it’s generally better to stick to one if you can. Even if a novel has several leading characters, all of them of seemingly equal importance, it is usually possible to single out one of them as laying at the novel’s core.

### Other Major Characters
These characters can be virtually indistinguishable from the protagonist.  They will receive a large amount of “screen time”.  They will possibly be the viewpoint character for significant chunks of the story. That is, they will have chapters of their own to be the narrator.  And they will most likely have their own subplot.  The overall story will be “about” the protagonist. But the subplots, each of which should have a bearing on the main plot, will be “about” one or other of the major characters.
What do I mean by a story or a plot being “about” a character?  If a plot consists of a character struggling against some form of opposition to achieve a specific goal, the character with the goal is the one the plot is “about”.  The novel’s central plot will be about the protagonist.  The subplots – which should be closely related to the main plot, weaving their way in and out of it – will be about the major characters.  Needless to say, each of your major characters should receive virtually as much care and attention during the planning process as your protagonist.

### Minor Characters
Minors are the exact opposite of major characters.  They will receive very little “screen time” and are unlikely to be a viewpoint character.  They won’t have their own subplots. At least not a subplot of any great length or significance.  Their appearances in the novel will be brief and infrequent. Although that doesn’t mean that they can’t shine whenever they are in the spotlight.  Minors are essentially two-dimensional stereotypes, or flat characters. So there’s no need to spend much time fleshing them out on paper before you begin to write.  A few broad brushstrokes will be all you need.

### Extras
Just as a movie needs hundreds of extra characters for the crowd scenes, so too do novels.  If your character eats in a restaurant or walks down the street and there is no mention of the people around them, the scene will lack realism.  The good news is that extras in novels aren’t really characters at all, more a part of the setting. They’re unlikely to speak or even get a name. And if they are singled out at all, they don’t need to be characterized so much as “labelled” (a young girl clutching a doll, a fat man reading a newspaper, and so on).  And what all of that means is that extras don’t involve much work. Hardly any, in fact. All you must remember to do is to mention them, just as you would mention other aspects of the setting. Like trees and motor cars and what the weather is doing.  So if your central character is traveling on a bus, for example, don’t just describe the dirty windows and the uncomfortable seats. Describe the passengers, too, perhaps singling out the odd interesting one.
