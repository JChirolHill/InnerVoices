# Dynamic vs. Static Characters

### Dynamic
A dynamic character is a character who undergoes significant internal change throughout the course of a story. The development of a dynamic character is often subtle and unstated and is not due to a change in the character’s circumstances. A dynamic character is one who learns a lesson or changes as a person (either for better or for worse). Most main characters and major characters in stories are dynamic.
Dynamic characters are considered a mark of a good story, because they are interesting to watch progress and help audiences become invested in the character’s journey.

### Static
A static character is a type of character who remains largely the same throughout the course of the storyline. Their environment may change, but they retain the same personality and outlook as they had at the beginning of the story. It’s common for secondary characters in stories to be static.

### Key Differences
Role in the story: Overall, the protagonists in stories tend to be dynamic characters (like Ebenezer Scrooge), while the antagonists tend to be static characters (like Captain Hook). However, this isn’t always the case—Darth Vader is a famously dynamic antagonist, while Sherlock Holmes is a famously static protagonist.
Audience interest: In general, audiences are much more invested in dynamic characters, because the audience can engage with the character’s arc and root for them to change. Static characters need to have very interesting personalities and a significant amount of character depth in order to hold audience members’ attention in the same way.
